# Two-Phase Java Solver

A direct port of Shuang's two-phase solver from Java to Javascript. It runs significantly more slowly than the GWT-compiled version, but is much shorter and easier to read.
For the GWT port, see the [3x3x3 scrambler for Mark 2](https://github.com/lgarron/mark2/blob/master/inc/scramblers/scramble_333.js).
