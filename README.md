# Projects by Shuang Chen

This repository contains code from several amazing projects by [Shuang Chen](http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/p.php?i=2008CHEN27). The code in this repository should be considered defunct, but I'm leaving it up for archival purposes.

Shuang's code, including [min2phase](https://github.com/ChenShuang/min2phase) and [TPR-4x4x4-Solver](https://github.com/ChenShuang/TPR-4x4x4-Solver), is now available on his [GitHub page](https://github.com/ChenShuang).
